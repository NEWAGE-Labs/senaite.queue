This is an **EXPERIMENTAL PACKAGE**, use at your own risk

This package enables asynchronous tasks in Senaite to better handle concurrent
actions and processes when senaite's workload is high, especially for instances
with high-demand on writing to disk. 

At present time, this add-on provides support for workflow transitions for
analyses and worksheets mostly (e.g., verifications, submissions, assignment of
analyses to worksheets, creation of worksheets by using workseet templates, etc.).

Transitions for sample levels could be easily supported in a near future.

The asynchronous creation of Sample is not supported yet.
